A specialized Relay and Pooling "RePool" program running on the Solana blockchain, designed for high-efficiency token operations. This VM achieves up to 95% reduction in transaction fees and 80% reduction in account rent compared to standard token accounts through advanced virtualization techniques.

Forked from [(https://github.com/code-wallet/code-vm](https://github.com/code-payments/code-vm)

## Key Technical Features

- Non-custodial token management system
- Multi-bank memory architecture (A-D banks)
- Hot/cold storage optimization with compression
- Proof-based state verification
- Timelock enforcement mechanisms
- Advanced relay operations for private transfers
- Merkle-tree based state management
- PDA-based account system
- Circular state buffer implementation

## Core Components

1. Memory Management
   - Paged memory modules
   - Dynamic capacity scaling
   - Compressed cold storage
   - Hot state optimization

2. Account Types
   - Virtual timelock accounts
   - Nonce accounts for transaction sequencing
   - Relay accounts for private operations
   - Storage accounts for compressed states

3. Security Architecture
